# God's Eye
Welcome to the God's Eye project! In response to the COVID-19 pandemic, this tool has been developed to detect the number of people in an image. During these challenging times, it is crucial to adhere to social distancing guidelines, and this project aims to contribute by identifying and monitoring the presence of people in groups.

## Features
- **People Detection:** God's Eye uses computer vision techniques to analyze images and determine the count of individuals present.

- **Tkinter UI:** The project includes a user-friendly Tkinter-based graphical user interface (GUI) for ease of interaction.
